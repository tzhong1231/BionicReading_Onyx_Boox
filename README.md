# BionicReading_Onyx_Boox

I'm not a coder, this is a specific alteration for using Bionic Reading for Onyx_Boox.

I don't know how to use gitHub, "</" kept disappearing from line 72 of my code, I don't know why that's happening, I'm not sure if the code will work, but if there's an error showing up, check that line first.

check original post for instructions on how to use it.

specifically, instead of tryping brec.py in your command, change it to brec_for_boox.py nameofyourbook.epub
